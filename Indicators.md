# List of indicators
This list contains all Norwegian Indicators for Alien Species.

## Spread (pathways)
The spread category contains four indicators, for all of which there is **R** code.

### S1 – Introduction rate of novel alien species
**R** code for S1 is [available](S1.R).

Note that the script can only be run if the following two datasets are downloaded first:
* [Data from: Ecological impact assessments of alien species in Norway (Sandvik et al. 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8sf7m0cjc)
* [Data from: Pathways of introduction of alien species in Norway (Sandvik et al. 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtg7)

### S2 – Active pathways of introduction
**R** code for S2 is [available](S2.R).

Note that the script can only be run if the following two datasets are downloaded first:
* [Data from: Ecological impact assessments of alien species in Norway (Sandvik et al. 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8sf7m0cjc)
* [Data from: Pathways of introduction of alien species in Norway (Sandvik et al. 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtg7)

### S3 – Active pathways of secondary spread
**R** code for S3 is [available](S3.R).

Note that the script can only be run if the following two datasets are downloaded first:
* [Data from: Ecological impact assessments of alien species in Norway (Sandvik et al. 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8sf7m0cjc)
* [Data from: Pathways of introduction of alien species in Norway (Sandvik et al. 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtg7)

### S4 – Import rate reported from monitoring
**R** code for S4 is [not yet available](S4.R).

## Pressure (impacts)
The pressure category contains five indicators, for all of which there is **R** code.

### P1 – Number of alien species
**R** code for P1 is [not yet available](P1.R).

### P2 – Extent of terrestrial alien species
**R** code for P2 is [not yet available](P2.R).

### P3 – Extent of alien freshwater species
**R** code for P3 is [not yet available](P3.R).

### P4 – Extent of marine alien species
**R** code for P4 is [not yet available](P4.R).

### P5 – Alien species reported from monitoring
**R** code for P5 is [not yet available](P5.R).

## Threat (state)
The threat category contains three indicators, for two of which there is **R** code.

### T1 – Threat to native species
**R** code for T1 will be published elsewhere.

### T2 – Threat to ecosystems
**R** code for T2 will be published elsewhere.

### T3 – Threat to ecosystem services
For indicator T3, no **R** code is available.

## Input
For input indicators, no **R** script is available (yet).

The indicators are:
* I1 – Money spent
* I2 – Contribution of different sectors
* I3 – Regulatory framework
* I4 – Regional planning coverage
* I5 – Goal-orientation of the Action Plan

## Result (output)
For result indicators, no **R** script is available (yet).

The indicators are:
* R1 – Extent of measures against terrestrial alien species
* R2 – Extent of measures against alien freshwater species
* R3 – Extent of measures against marine alien species
* R4 – Extent of ecosystem-oriented measures
* R5 – Extent of measures in protected areas
* R6 – Area surveyed
* R7 – Measures with cost–benefit analysis

## Effect (outcomes)
For effect indicators, no **R** script is available (yet).

The indicators are:
* E1 – Alien species eradicated
* E2 – Successful measures against terrestrial alien species
* E3 – Successful measures against alien freshwater species
* E4 – Successful measures against marine alien species
