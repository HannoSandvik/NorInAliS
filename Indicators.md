# List of indicators
This list contains all Norwegian Indicators for Alien Species. Where applicable, links to **R** code and **R** Markdown files are provided. Many of the scripts use some common auxiliary functions, which are available [here](function.r).

## Spread (pathways)
The spread category contains four indicators, for all of which there is **R** code.

### S1 – Introduction rate of novel alien species
For S1, there is [**R** code](S1.R) and an [**R** Markdown file](S1.rmd).

The script reads two external datasets ([Sandvik et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8sf7m0cjc), [2022](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtg7)).

### S2 – Active pathways of introduction
For S2, there is [**R** code](S2.R) and an [**R** Markdown file](S2.rmd).

The script reads two external datasets ([Sandvik et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8sf7m0cjc), [2022](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtg7)).

### S3 – Active pathways of secondary spread
For S3, there is [**R** code](S3.R) and an [**R** Markdown file](S3.rmd).

The script reads two external datasets ([Sandvik et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8sf7m0cjc), [2022](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtg7)).

### S4 – Import rate reported from monitoring
**R** code for S4 is [available](S4.R).

It utilises data that have been read from NINA's [survey of stowaways in imported ornamental plants](https://view.nina.no/planteimport/).

## Pressure (impacts)
The pressure category contains five indicators, for all of which there is **R** code.

### P1 – Number of alien species
**R** code for P1 is [available](P1.R).

The scripts reads an external dataset ([Sandvik et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8sf7m0cjc)).

### P2 – Extent of terrestrial alien species
**R** code for P2 is [available](P2.R).

The scripts reads an external dataset ([Sandvik et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8sf7m0cjc)).

### P3 – Extent of alien freshwater species
**R** code for P3 is [not yet available](P3.R).

### P4 – Extent of marine alien species
**R** code for P4 is [not yet available](P4.R).

### P5 – Alien species reported from monitoring
**R** code for P5 is [not yet available](P5.R).

## Threat (state)
The threat category contains three indicators, for two of which there is **R** code.

### T1 – Threat to native species
**R** code for T1 will be published elsewhere.

### T2 – Threat to ecosystems
**R** code for T2 will be published elsewhere.

### T3 – Threat to ecosystem services
For indicator T3, no **R** code is available.

## Input
For input indicators, no **R** script is available (yet).

The indicators are:
* I1 – Money spent
* I2 – Contribution of different sectors
* I3 – Regulatory framework
* I4 – Regional planning coverage
* I5 – Goal-orientation of the Action Plan

## Result (output)
For result indicators, no **R** script is available (yet).

The indicators are:
* R1 – Extent of measures against terrestrial alien species
* R2 – Extent of measures against alien freshwater species
* R3 – Extent of measures against marine alien species
* R4 – Extent of ecosystem-oriented measures
* R5 – Extent of measures in protected areas
* R6 – Area surveyed
* R7 – Measures with cost–benefit analysis

## Effect (outcomes)
The effect category contains four indicators, for one of which there is **R** code.

### E1 – Alien species eradicated
**R** code for E1 is [available](E1.R).

It utilises data that have been published by Sandvik et al. ([2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-019-02058-x)).

### E2 – Successful measures against terrestrial alien species
For indicator E2, no **R** code is available.

### E3 – Successful measures against alien freshwater species
For indicator E3, no **R** code is available.

### E4 – Successful measures against marine alien species
For indicator E4, no **R** code is available.
