## Introduction

This code calculates indicator P4 of
[NorInAliS](https://github.com/HannoSandvik/NorInAliS).

## Preparations

Define auxiliary functions:

    # Combines text strings
    "%+%" <- function(string1, string2) paste0(string1, string2)


    # I just find this more intuitive...
    "%contains%" <- function (textstring, searchtext) grepl(searchtext, textstring)

Load data from the Alien Species List 2018 ([Sandvik et
al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8sf7m0cjc)):

    fab  <- read.csv2(url("https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/359484"),
                      as.is=T)

The AOOs (areas of occupancy, in km<sup>2</sup>) provided in the above
dataset are only the *best* estimates of the *total* AOO for each
species (i.e. the *median* expert judgement of the *real* AOO, including
“dark figures” or unreported occurrences). However, in order to quantify
uncertainty, P2 needs more than that, viz. the *low* and *high*
estimates of the total AOO (i.e. lower and upper *quartiles*) as well as
the *known* AOO (i.e. excluding dark figures). These values are here
read from a separate file. Their source is
<https://artsdatabanken.no/fremmedartslista2018>.

    aoo <- read.csv2("../cache/aoo.csv", as.is=T)

Restrict data to alien species that are reproducing unaidedly in
mainland Norway:

    fab <- fab[which(fab$Status == "reproducing" & fab$Mainl),]

Restrict the data to marine species:

    w <- which(fab$LifeSt %in%
               c("mar", "mar,par"))
    fab <- fab[w,]
    aoo <- aoo[w,]

Restrict data to coastal and bottom-dwelling species (This is based on
ecosystem codes defined by “Nature in Norway”, according to the EcoSyst
framework, see [Halvorsen et
al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13164)):

    w <- delete <- which(fab$Ecosys %contains% "H01" & !(fab$Ecosys %contains% "M"))
    if (length(w)) {
      for (i in w) {
        if (fab$Ecosys[i] %contains% "H01-05") {
          if (!(paste(unlist(strsplit(fab$Ecosys[i], ",")) %-% "H01-05",
                      collapse=",") %contains% "H01")) {
            delete <- w %-% i
          }
        }
      }
      if (length(delete)) {
        cat(length(delete) %+% " marine species " %+% ifelse(length(delete) == 1,
            "is omitted because it is", "are omitted because they are") %+%
            " not coastal or bottom-dwelling:\n")
        for (i in delete) {
          cat("* " %+% fab$Name[i] %+% "\n")
        }
        fab <- fab[-delete,]
        aoo <- aoo[-delete,]
      }
    }

    ## 2 marine species are omitted because they are not coastal or bottom-dwelling:
    ## * Mnemiopsis leidyi
    ## * Penilia avirostris

Make sure that the two data frames are compatible:

    if (all(fab$Name == aoo$Name)) {
      cat("Everything is fine.\n")
    } else {
      cat("ERROR: For some reason, the two dataframes are not compatible!\n")
    }

    ## Everything is fine.

Load the relevant data from the reporting system for the Water Framework
Directive (WFD) in Norway (for details, [see indicator P3](P3.rmd)):

    WFD <- read.csv("../cache/WFD.csv", sep=";", dec=".", as.is=TRUE, encoding="latin1")

Restrict the data to coastal waterbodies:

    WFD <- WFD[which(WFD$Category == "Coastal"), ]
    head(WFD)

    ##                 ID                          Name Category   Area Length           Species Impact Regional

How many alien species are reported in the two datasets?

    {
      cat("Alien Species List 2018:   " %+% length(unique(fab$Name))    %+% " spp.\n")
      cat("Water Framework Directive: " %+% length(unique(WFD$Species)) %+% " spp.\n")
    }

    ## Alien Species List 2018:   32 spp.
    ## Water Framework Directive: 3 spp.

Specify the total number and size of waterbodies (from
[Vann-nett](https://vann-nett.no/portal/#/area/1/all)):

    Ncoast <-  2283  # number of coastal waterbodies
    Acoast <- 93649  # total area of coastal waterbodies in square kilometres

## Functions

The estimation of indicator definition P4(a) uses the same functions as
indicator [P2 (see there)](P2.rmd). They are here loaded invisibly.

## Error checking and correction

Check for obvious errors in the original data:

**(1)** Is any low estimate greater than the corresponding best
estimate?

    w <- which(aoo$low > aoo$best)
    if (length(w)) {
      print(aoo[w,])
    } else {
      cat("Everything is fine.\n")
    }

    ## Everything is fine.

**(2)** Is any high estimate less than the corresponding best estimate?

    w <- which(aoo$high < aoo$best)
    if (length(w)) {
      print(aoo[w,])
    } else {
      cat("Everything is fine.\n")
    }

    ## Everything is fine.

**(3)** By definition, AOOs are multiples of 4 square kilometres. Some
figures are incompatible with this definition. We solve this by rounding
upwards:

    aoo[, 2:5] <- ceiling(aoo[, 2:5] / 4) * 4

**(4)** Is any AOO greater than the area of mainland Norway?

    w <- which(aoo$high > 323800)
    if (length(w)) {
      print(aoo[w,])
    } else {
      cat("Everything is fine.\n")
    }

    ## Everything is fine.

## Simulations

If you want P2 for *high- and severe-impact* species only, do this first
(not run):

    aoo <- aoo[which(fab$Impact %in% c("HI", "SE")),]
    WFD <- WFD[which(WFD$Impact %in% c("HI", "SE")),]

If you want P2 for the *remaining* species only, do this first (not
run):

    aoo <- aoo[which(fab$Impact %in% c("NK", "LO", "PH")),]
    WFD <- WFD[which(WFD$Impact %in% c("NK", "LO", "PH")),]

If you want P2 for *all* alien species (**default**), do none of the
above.

Then start the simulation:

    AOO <- P2(aoo)
    avg   <-     mean(apply(AOO, 1, sum))
    stdev <-       sd(apply(AOO, 1, sum))
    conf  <- quantile(apply(AOO, 1, sum), c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975))

Output of the results:

    { 
      cat("P4(a) is " %+% round(avg,   -2) %+% " km² ± " %+%
                          round(stdev, -2) %+% " km² (mean ± SD)\n\n")
      cat("Confidence levels (in km²):\n")
      print(round(conf, -2))
    }

    ## P4(a) is 202200 km² ± 64300 km² (mean ± SD)
    ## 
    ## Confidence levels (in km²):
    ##   2.5%    25%    50%    75%  97.5% 
    ## 113200 156500 189700 233800 369600

## Calculation of WFD-based indicator definitions

Create a variable for the results:

    P4 <- matrix(round(avg), 1, 5, 
          dimnames=list("Coastal", c("P4(a)", "P4(b)", "P4(c)", "Area", "P4(d)")))

Estimate P4(b):

    P4[1, 2] <- length(unique(WFD$ID))

Estimate P4(c):

    P4[1, 3] <- P4[1, 2] / Ncoast

Estimate P4(d):

    P4[1, 4] <- 0
    for (i in unique(WFD$ID)) {
      A <- WFD$Area[which(WFD$ID == i)[1]]
      # to ensure that every waterbody is only counted once
      if (!is.na(A)) {
        P4[1, 4] <- P4[1, 4] + A
      }
    }
    P4[1, 5] <- P4[1, 4] / Acoast
    P4[1, 4] <- round(P4[1, 4])

Output of the results, where

-   **P4(a)** is the *sum of areas of occupancies* (in square
    kilometres) of all coastal or bottom-dwelling marine alien species
    that are recorded as reproducing unaidedly in Norway, including
    estimated dark figures of the areas of occupancy,
-   **P4(b)** is the *number* of coastal waterbodies in which at least
    one alien species is recorded as an ongoing impact according to the
    Water Framework Directive,
-   **P4(c)** is the *proportion* of coastal waterbodies in which at
    least one alien species is recorded as an ongoing impact according
    to the Water Framework Directive,
-   **Area** is the cumulative *area* of coastal waterbodies (in square
    kilometres) in which at least one alien species is recorded as an
    ongoing impact according to the Water Framework Directive,
-   **P4(d)** is the *proportion* of the *area* of coastal waterbodies
    in which at least one alien species is recorded as an ongoing impact
    according to the Water Framework Directive:
